# SIMPET
Project for BU MET CS 622

The SIMPET pet simulation system is a virtual pet platform that allows users to create and customize virtual companions,
choosing from a variety of species and breeds. The user can create pets through CLI prompts OR submitting a csv file
with pet information. Users must take care of their virtual pets by regularly feeding, playing, training, and doing
other activities with them. The pet's health, mood, and behavior are affected by the user's actions, and the pet grows
and ages over time, creating a realistic simulation of pet ownership. The petsâ€™ information is then conveniently
printed to a file for the user to review. Pet info is also saved to a bin file for convenient retrieval on successive
uses of the program.

ChatGPT was used to help build the starter code, and the AI prompts and answers can be viewed
in the ChatGptSimPet.md file.

### Running Instructions

Clone the repo locally and navigate to the main.PetSimulation Java Class. Run the "main" method and follow
the prompts to see your virtual pet come to life. Pet data is saved to the savedPets.bin file, so
make sure saved data exists before loading from the file.
