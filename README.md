# SIMPET
Project for BU MET CS 622

The SIMPET pet simulation system is a virtual pet platform that allows users to create and customize virtual companions, choosing from a variety of species and breeds. The user can create pets through CLI prompts OR by loading them from the database. Users must take care of their virtual pets by regularly feeding, playing, training, and doing other activities with them. The pet's health, mood, and behavior are affected by the user's actions, and the pet grows and ages over time, creating a realistic simulation of pet ownership. The petsâ€™ information is then saved to the database and conveniently printed to a text file for the user to review.

ChatGPT was used to help build the starter code, and the AI prompts and answers can be viewed
in the ChatGptSimPet.md file.

### Running Instructions

1. Clone the repo locally. 
2. If you have a copy of the postgres DB, please import it locally using PgAdmin or another 
similar UI program, and ask me for login credentials, unless you want to use your own. Alternatively, you can run 
the java classes in the 'scripts' folder to populate a new database with some test data. 
3. Navigate to the main.PetSimulation Java Class. Run the "main" method and follow the prompts to see your virtual pet 
come to life.
