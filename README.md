# SIMPET
Project for BU MET CS 622

The SIMPET pet simulation system is a virtual pet platform that allows users to create and customize 
virtual companions, choosing from a variety of species and breeds. Users must take care of their 
virtual pets by regularly feeding, playing, training, and doing other activities with them. 
The pet's health, happiness, and behavior are affected by the user's actions, and the pet grows 
and ages over time, creating a realistic simulation of pet ownership.

ChatGPT was used to help build the starter code, and the AI prompts and answers can be viewed
in the ChatGptSimPet.java file.

### Running Instructions

Clone the repo locally and navigate to the PetSimulation Java Class. Run the "main" method and follow
the prompts to see your virtual pet come to life.
