# CHATGPT Prompts and outputs for the project 

The below is starter code generated by ChatGPT for the PetSim pet simulation. I have moved the classes over into
their own separate files for readability rather than rely on this one file to run the program. I also added a lot
more to the main function, as I wanted to include user input to create a user and desired pets.
The prompt was: "Please code an implementation for a pet simulation system that allows a user to create a pet
and take care of it throughout its simulated lifetime. using Java that implements inheritance,
downcasting, and polymorphism. Make sure the main.Pet class is abstract."

## Basic Classes

`abstract class main.Pet {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;
    protected int health;
    protected int mood;

    public main.Pet(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 0;
        this.health = 100;
        this.mood = 100;
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println(name + " is playing!");
        mood += 10;
    }

    public abstract void feed();

    public abstract void train(String trick);

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(name + " is sleeping!");
        mood += 20;
    }

    public void getOlder() {
        age += 1;
        health -= 10;
        if (health <= 0) {
            System.out.println(name + " has died!");
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Health: " + health + ", Mood: " + mood;
    }
}

class main.Dog extends main.Pet {
    public main.Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void feed() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating dog food.");
        mood += 5;
    }

    public void train(String trick) {
        System.out.println(name + " is learning to " + trick + ".");
        mood += 10;
    }
}

class main.Cat extends main.Pet {
    public main.Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public void feed() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating cat food.");
        mood += 5;
    }

    public void train(String trick) {
        System.out.println(name + " is ignoring you.");
        mood -= 5;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        main.Pet fido = new main.Dog("Fido");
        System.out.println("You have created a new dog named " + fido.name + ".");
        fido.feed();
        fido.play();
        fido.train("roll over");
        fido.sleep();
        fido.getOlder();
        System.out.println(fido.toString());

        main.Pet mittens = new main.Cat("Mittens");
        System.out.println("You have created a new cat named " + mittens.name + ".");
        mittens.feed();
        mittens.play();
        mittens.train("jump through hoop");
        mittens.sleep();
        mittens.getOlder();
        System.out.println(mittens.toString());

        // Downcasting example
        if (fido instanceof main.Dog) {
            main.Dog dogFido = (main.Dog) fido;
            dogFido.train("shake");
        }

        // Polymorphism example
        main.Pet[] pets = {fido, mittens};
        for (main.Pet pet : pets) {
            pet.feed();
            pet.play();
            pet.train("fetch");
            pet.sleep();
        }
    }
}`

## App logic

For the below I gave Chatgpt another prompt:
Using the above Java starter code, please write a Java program that simulates a pet's life.

The program should
1. As the user to input a user name and create a user instance.
2. Ask the user to name pets they would want a select a type until they are satisfied with their pets. Those pets should be stored in an array variable in the user class.
3. The program should print information onscreen related to the pets the user has.
4. The program should ask the user which pet they want to interact with and how, and print information related to that onscreen.
5. The user should be able to exit the program at any time by entering "exit".
6. before closing the program should print out everything it has printed onscreen onto an output file named petReportcard.txt
7. The program should feature an abstract pet class, inheritance, polymorphism, and upcasting or downcasting.

Again I opted to copying the result over into a separate file for readability. This result was a little rough, so a
lot of format and syntax fixing needed to be done, but overall it was an impressive result.

        if (petType.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
            running = false;

            for(

    // Interact with pets
            while(true)

            break;
        } else {
            try {
                int petIndex = Integer.parseInt(input) - 1;
                if (petIndex < 0 || petIndex >= user.getPets().size()) {
                    System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a valid pet number or Exit.");
                    continue;

    // Write pet report card to file
        try

    {
        FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("petReportcard.txt");
        PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(fileWriter);

        for (main.Pet pet : user.getPets()) {
            printWriter.println(pet.toString());
        }

        printWriter.close();

    {
        System.out.println("An error occurred while writing to the file.");
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    System
}`

## Unit Tests

I asked ChatGpt to write some unit tests, as well. Below was the prompt:
Add junit unit tests for the main.Dog class, which extends the main.Pet abstract class.
Please use a BeforeEach method to set up the class for testing.

 `import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
 import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

 import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

 public class test.DogTest {
 private main.Dog dog;

 @BeforeEach
 public void setUp() {
 dog = new main.Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
 }

 @Test
 public void testGetName() {
 assertEquals("Buddy", dog.getName());
 }

 @Test
 public void testFeed() {
 dog.feed();
 assertEquals(105, dog.getMood());
 }

 @Test
 public void testTrain() {
 dog.train("sit");
 assertEquals(110, dog.getMood());
 }

 @Test
 public void testGetBreed() {
 assertEquals("Golden Retriever", dog.getBreed());
 }

 // Additional test methods can be added for other behaviors of the main.Dog class
 }`
